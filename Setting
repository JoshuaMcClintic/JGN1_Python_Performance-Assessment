As a data analyst working at an event planning company, one of your essential responsibilities involves procuring
suitable coverings for events of different sizes, such as tents, canopies, and other temporary shelters. To choose the
correct size and type of covering for an event at a particular location, it is crucial to know what conditions to expect
at that location at the time of year of the event. This information must be collected and stored in the company database
so that other teams can refer to it throughout the planning process.

Weather data is commonly collected by several federal and local agencies and supplied through free publicly available
APIs; you will use the "Weather API" web link for this project. For this task, you will develop a Python program to
collect historical weather information for a location and date from the previous five years, store that in a local
database for testing purposes, then query the record you created to ensure it was stored correctly.
